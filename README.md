# **Project Overview:**  
  Briefly describe the goal of the project (analyzing citrus fruit data, visualizing relationships, and applying linear regression).

- **Data Source:**  
  Mention the `citrus.csv` file and its location in the `data` folder.

- **Main Features:**  
  - Data loading and preparation
  - Visualization of diameter vs. weight
  - Linear regression analysis
  - Prediction and error evaluation
  - Handling missing values

- **How to Run:**  
  Instructions for running the notebook and any dependencies (Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib).

- **Results:**  
  Summarize the main findings (relationship between diameter and weight, regression equation, error metrics).

- **Future Work:**  
  Suggest possible extensions, such as analyzing other fruit types, using more advanced models, or integrating with real-world applications.
